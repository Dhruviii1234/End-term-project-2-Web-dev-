Problem Statement

Managing daily tasks efficiently can be challenging without a clear system. Many existing tools are either too complex or distracting for basic use.

The goal of this project is to build a lightweight task management app that allows users to:
- Add and manage tasks easily
- Categorize tasks for better organization
- Track completed vs pending tasks
- Store tasks locally so they are not lost on refresh

 Features Implemented

-  Add new tasks with a task name
-  Categorize tasks (General, Study, Health, Personal)
-  Mark tasks as completed or incomplete
-  Delete individual tasks
-  Clear all completed tasks at once
-  Task statistics (Total tasks & Completed tasks)
-  Automatic timestamp for each task
-  Light / Dark mode toggle
-  LocalStorage support to persist tasks after page reload
-  Clean, modern UI with gradient background and animations
